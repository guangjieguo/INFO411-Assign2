# INFO411-Assignment-2
This readme provides a brief sturcture to our project on heart disease data analysis.
## Content
 - [Visualization](#visualization)
   - In this part, we explore the statistical properties of the data. We build nice pictures to illustrate the properties of the data, such distribution of each feature and target, correlations between features and target, PCA, t-SNE, etc.
 - [Imputation](#imputation)
   - For data imputation, the file contains the use of Knn and Random Forest as the main methods based on the Cleveland, Swiss and Va datasets.
 - [Modelling](#modelling)
   - We build our models based on the cleaned Cleveland dataset. We fine-tuned and compared several kinds of models, such as Decision tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc. Furthermore, those models are trained on the whole Cleveland dataset and tested on other locationsâ€™ imputed datasets.
 - [Dashboard](#dashboard) _Something Interesting!_
   - Interface of Heart Disease Diagnosis
   - KNN Modelling
   - t-SNE
 - [Report](#report)
   - A summary of our work.
